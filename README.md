### 🛠 setup/
Contains information related to the **lab configuration**.

#### lab-info.txt
Includes:
- Attacker and target machine details
- Network configuration (Host-only adapter)
- Target IP addressing
- Purpose of the lab environment

This ensures the lab can be **recreated easily** by others.

---

### 📡 scanning/
Focused on **network reconnaissance and service discovery**.

#### nmap-basic-scan.txt
Contains:
- Nmap command(s) used
- Raw scan output
- Identified open ports and services
- Initial observations

This phase helps define the **attack surface** of the target system.

---

### 🌐 web-testing/
Dedicated to **basic web application security testing**.

#### basic-web-findings.txt
Documents:
- Manual testing observations
- Authentication weaknesses
- Insecure HTTP usage
- General misconfigurations

The goal is to identify **common and easily exploitable web risks** without
performing advanced exploitation.
